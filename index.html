			<h1>Why Enviornmental Awareness Is Important</h1>
			<h3 class="contents">Environmental awareness means exactly what you may think: an awareness around the natural environment and the choices that either promote its well-being or cause it more harm. It is also the awareness that the earth is in need of protection for its survival. Along with this, the term “environmentalism” is an ideology that humans are responsible to protect and preserve the environment from human-caused afflictions.
			As previously stated, human-made choices are the number one reason why the planet is becoming sicker every day. Environmentalism on a large scale is one of the best ways to combat the devastating consequences of these human decisions and help the planet’s health take a complete 180 degree in the other direction.</h3>
			<h1>Major Enviornmental Problems</h1>
			<h3 class="contents" id="Enviornmental-Issues">Some environmental life species require substantial areas to help provide food, living space, and other different assets. These creatures are called area specific.
			At the point when the biome is divided, the vast patches of living space don’t exist anymore. It becomes more troublesome for the wildlife to get the assets they need in order to survive. The environment goes on, even though the animals and plant life are not there to help sustain it properly.</h3>

				</div>
				<div class="feature-description">
					<p>The adverse environmental effects of a range of land use activities that involve
						disturbance of the land by either vegetation removal or by physical ground disturbance, such as cultivation,
						intensive stocking, excavation, mining or track construction. The effects of land disturbance may include
						damage to soil, induced or accelerated erosion or slope instability, sediment generation and deposition in
						surface and subsurface water bodies. Other effects may include changes to river channels following
						deposition of sediment, water contamination and adverse effects on aquatic habitats, or cave habitats,
						adverse visual appearance of disturbed land, and damage or destruction of natural habitats, karst features,
					or sites or areas of cultural heritage significance.</p>

				<div class="feature-description">
					<p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance or energy. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.</p>

					<span>Population</span>
				</div>
				<div class="feature-description">
					<p>
					Human population growth impacts the Earth system in a variety of ways, including: Increasing the extraction of resources from the environment. These resources include fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal), minerals, trees, water, and wildlife, especially in the oceans.Housing and feeding so many people has accelerated the destruction of natural habitats, while higher levels of consumption, particularly in some richer parts of the world, have also increased the exploitation of natural resources and led to growing levels of pollution.The 5 effects of rapid population growth are increased economic growth of a country, growing demand for jobs, lack of housing and schools, lack of infrastructure leading to poor living, and increase in pollution and waste.</p>

					<span>Landfills</span>
				</div>
				<div class="feature-description">
					<p>Along with methane, landfills also produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, and trace amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and non methane organic compounds. These gases can also contribute to climate change and create smog if left uncontrolled.The by-products of solid wastes deposited in a landfill adversely affect the surrounding environment and communities near landfill sites. Communities have immediate negative impacts from pollutants that arise from landfilling organic waste, like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter that cause heart and lung disease.Soil around the dumpsites contains higher concentration of various heavy metals. Contaminants from the dumpsites decreases the strength of soil. Soil contamination also effect the survival of vegetation around the dumpsite.</p>

					<span>Deforestation</span>
				</div>
				<div class="feature-description">
					<p>Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into modern times, forests have been razed to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction. Deforestation has greatly altered landscapes around the world.The loss of clean water and biodiversity from all forests could have many other effects we can't foresee, touching even your morning cup of coffee. In terms of climate change, cutting trees both adds carbon dioxide to the air and removes the ability to absorb existing carbon dioxide.Preserving tropical forests helps protect the millions of plant and animal species—many of which have been invaluable to human medicine—that are indigenous to tropical forests and in danger of extinction. Keeping forests intact also helps prevent floods and drought by regulating regional rainfall.</p>

					<h3>Impact On Human Health</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Areas exposed to toxic air pollutants can cause respiratory problems like pneumonia and asthma. Millions of people are known to have died due to the indirect effects of air pollution.</p>

					<h3>Loss Of Biodiversity</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Biodiversity, or the variety of all living things on our planet, has been declining at an alarming rate in recent years, mainly due to human activities, such as land use changes, pollution and climate change.</p>

					<h3>Ozone Layer Depletion</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Ozone Depletion. When chlorine and bromine atoms come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules. One chlorine atom can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the stratosphere. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created.</p>

					<h3>Loss For The Touism Industry</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Tourism often puts pressure on natural resources through over-consumption, often in places where resources are already scarce. Tourism puts enormous stress on local land use, and can lead to soil erosion, increased pollution, natural habitat loss, and more pressure on endangered species.</p>

					<h3>Economic Impact</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>An economic impact analysis typically measures or estimates the change in economic activity between two scenarios, one assuming the economic event occurs, and one assuming it does not occur (which is referred to as the counterfactual case). This can be accomplished either before or after the event (ex ante or ex post).</p>

					<h3>Global Warming</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Global warming is observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.</p>
